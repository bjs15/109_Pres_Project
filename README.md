# 109_Pres_Project
In this git there are 4 files; CS109_President_Project.py, write_simulations.py, simulation_results.csv, and analyze_results.py.
CS109_President_Project.py includes both the optional display mode and option to choose which benefit is active. If you choose not to have display mode, then you can simulate as many games as you'd like and see how many times each player wins.
write_simulations.py when run simply runs the simulation 100,000 times with each benefit randomly assigned active or inactive each game, and writes in the settings and whether Player 1 wins into simulation_results.csv.
analyze_results.py has the binary logistic regression code and prints out the probabilities.
